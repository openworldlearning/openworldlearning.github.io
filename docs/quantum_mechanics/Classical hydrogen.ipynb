    "**How is it that classical physics is unable to properly describe the microscopic world?** Unless you have a firm grasp on classical physics, this is not a straightforward problem to dig in to. As it turns out, the answer is not so much about stuff missing in our the classical theories, but rather about intrinsic misconceptions about nature resulting in predictions which contradicts what we actually observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we’ll explore the microscopic world through a classical lens, face some of the problematic predictions, ponder some possible solutions, and anticipate how the problem can be resolved by actually relaxing the confines of classical physics. Our goal is ultimately do gain deeper insight into the basis for quantum mechanics, and highlight it's importance in chemistry."
