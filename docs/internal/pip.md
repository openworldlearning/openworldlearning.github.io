## PyPI

The Python Package Index (PyPI), what we typically just call 'pip', is our main tool for distributing the latest versions of our python modules.

While it comes preinstalled on OSX and Ubuntu, you'll have to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/">install it manually on windows.</a>. 

Whenever you are missing a package, you can run (either from terminal or inside a notebook using !):

=== "OSX/Ubuntu"

    ```pip install [package]
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```python -m pip install [package]
    ```


## Relevant modules

The basic modules required for this project can be installed with

```pip install numpy matplotlib evince braketlab bubblebox btjenesten```

I'll add more to the list as we realize they are missing.
