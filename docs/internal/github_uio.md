## Github at the University

In addition to using Github.com, we'll be using the enterprise version only open to UiO students and staff. 

The workflow is identical to the open github, but your user may be different. Log in with your university credentials on 

<a href="https://github.uio.no/">https://github.uio.no/</a>

Let me know your username, and I'll add you to the relevant repositories. For now, these are (in no particular order):
- KJM1130 (Hanan)
- KJM5610 (Hanan)
- KJM3310 (Hanan)
- KJM2601 (Elias)

On these repositories you'll find exercises, code examples and teaching material from the various courses. Feel free to integrate this in your own work.

## Why not use the internal GitHub for everything?

GitHub.com has an estimated 73 million users worldwide, and is considered a kind of social network for developers. Having an active profile on github.com looks good on your CV and will allow you to connect with other developers. All software developed for the Open World Framework is open source (MIT Licence), and we have much to gain by being visible on github.
