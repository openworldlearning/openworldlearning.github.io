## Writing for students

1. Determine our audience
    - What is their background or level of expertise?
    - In wich context are they reading your text (individually, in groups, at home)?
2. Set the goals:
    - What should ideally be the learning outcome?
    - What should be performed?
3. Motivate the reader:
    - Clarify the connections to other topics (or theory and experiment).
    - Relate broadly early on to captivate a multitude of readers.
    - Provide the reader with examples on how this will benefit them.
4. Be inclusive and inviting:
    - Use "we" instead of "you".
    - Lead the way by means of friendly instructions; "think through...", "take into account that ... ", "let's ... " 
    - Use whole sentences, with mathematical expressions integrated in the text.
    - Avoid abbreviations.
5. Achieve clarity:
    - Motivate all new concepts as early in the text as possible.
    - Define new context at the beginning of each section.
    - Point out explicitly:
        - What the reader should focus on.
        - Where significant omissions or simplifications occur.
        - Where the problem arise.
        - What the proposed solution is.
        - What we expect the students to achieve.
    - Be consistent, even when it means repeating the same word.
    - Avoid derailing from the topic.
6. Use logical structures in the text where possible.
7. Use suitable examples.
8. Revise and simplify your texts regularly.
