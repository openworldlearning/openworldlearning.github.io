## Github

We will use github to update these pages and develop our ideas as they evolve.

1. First, you'll need to <a href="https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home">register as a Github user</a> (unless you already have one)
2. Next, you'll need to be added as a member of the <a href="https://github.com/audunsh/openworld">Open World</a> repository by <a href="a.s.hansen@kjemi.uio.no">Audun</a>.
3. You should then do the initial clone of the repository. Open a terminal and from a suitable folder, run: ```git clone https://github.com/audunsh/openworld.git```

If everything workes as intended, you do now have access to the repository, can edit, add and remove files, and push your changes.

## Useful commands

All commands should be run from within the local folder of the repository.

### See current status

To display state of files in the repository, run ```git status```

### Get latest changes to the repository

To download latest changes, run ```git pull```

### Update online repository with local changes

First you need to specify which files to update:

```git add [insert file]```

...then you explain what you are doing:

```git commit -m"[insert explanation]"Â ```

...finally, you upload the local changes to the online repository to make it available for all:

```git push```

(you'll be prompted for username and password)
