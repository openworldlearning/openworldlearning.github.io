## Software tailored for learning

### Author: Audun Skau Hansen

Since we do not actually possess the technology to shrink you down to the scale of molecules, creating experiences in the microscopic realm and beyond represents a real challenge. It essentially requires us to find interactive representations of the microscopic phenomenas and make them accessible to you.

In this respect, computational sciences offers almost everything we need. The reason it hasn't been a larger part of undergraduate curriculum previously, especially in chemistry, is perhaps because the traditional computational tools has had a rather steep learning curve. With modern high-level programming languages being more closely integrated in browser-technologies, this barrier is significantly lowered.

The Open World Learning framework comes with a wide range of tools specifically designed to facilitate authentic, engaging, realistic, and even immersive experiences on the microscopic scale. On the following pages, you'll become more familiar with BraketLab, B-tjenesten and BubbleBox.
