## Conventions

Our path will most likely evolve as we traverse it. 

In order to ensure a clean and fair workflow, however, we will follow some simple basic principles:

## 1. Put your name on your work

For exercises, explanatory text, functionality and other content, make sure you sign it with your name. This is done to both document who has contributed what, and make it easier to extend or remix the content for future usage. Do not hesitate in taking credit for your contributions.

## 2. Clarify the prerequisite knowledge

I am aware we do not yet have the full-fledged framework ready, but I'd like you to think carefully through what prerequisite knowledge is needed by the students when moving though your content/path. It should be written explicitly at the beginning of the notebook.

## 3. Keep it concise

Do not introduce too many concepts in each path. If it grows out of control, you should likely split it into multiple notebooks.
