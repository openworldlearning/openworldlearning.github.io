## Getting started

With the brief time available to us this summer it is important to get set up quickly. By *set up*, I mean installing the required software, getting familiar with the workflow, focus in on the relevant theory and let your mind be inspired and creative. Feel free to add or edit this guide as you see fit, and hopefully we'll be on our way in no time.
